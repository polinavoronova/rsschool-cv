            <p>IT is attracted me because it’s a rapidly growing industry and the possibilities for growth in this field as a career is endless. It’s an opportunity to work closely with the team to support projects during all phases of delivery, to work in the comfortable environment (even at my home or escaping the 8:30AM to 5PM work week, I also can be my own boss).<br />
                I want to work in a young and energetic team, to participate in different projects (which can deal with completely various areas). I want always evolving and constantly changing. I hope I'll always have the opportunity to interact with new tools and learn new skills, increase my knowledge. And I want to become financially independent.<br />
                I’m friendly, enthusiastic, collaborative, and I’m able to function well in a team. I think I’m analytical and capable of identifying creative solutions. I’m proud of myself because I graduated the BSU with honors. That made me a stronger person. I'm used to working hard and learning constantly.<br />
                I chose front-end development, because I can watch all the changes made instantly and it's also a field that provides many opportunities for hands-on learning.
